# Web Development Assignment 4

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* node.js
* express
* Vue.js

## Design Choices:
Express is used to control the layout of the page, such as displaying the navigation bar on certain pages, while hiding it on others(such as the login and signup pages), as allowing the user to have access to the navigation bar before they've logged in or signed up may allow them to access parts of the app they should not have at the time,  and allowing for the navigation of the site without refreshing the page. Vue.js was used client side for updating the feed/posts as well as dynamically displaying user data.


## Future Plans:
Future Plans for this project include implementation of the messaging function, and the trending users/topics sections

## Responsibilities:
Isaiah: Posts Feed, CRUD actions for user.


Ethan: User Authentication/cookies/

That is, first, run 'npm install' to install required dependencies, then 'node seed.js' to seed the local MongoDB, and finally start the program with 'npm start'

## HTML Checker Status

All checks passed
